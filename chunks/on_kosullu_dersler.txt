----------
COURSES MUST BE TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY:
As of the fall semester of 2017-2018 academic year, simultaneous courses will be applied for all students.
Simultaneous courses are required to be taken together in the same semester.
A student must take a course simultaneously during the course registration period.
----------
COURSES MUST BE TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY:
If the student has already passed one of the simultaneous courses, he/she can take the other course alone.
For example, if a student has already passed the BBM 451 Computer Networks course, he/she can enroll in BBM 453 alone.
